What does it do?

Our inspiration is to harness the power of technology to make a positive impact on the lives of visually impaired individuals. By utilizing AI, machine learning, computer vision, and other relevant technologies, our goal is to create a user-friendly solution that promotes inclusivity, equality, and independence for blind individuals. We are committed to leveraging technology to enhance accessibility and empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their environment, access information, and perform daily tasks with confidence and independence.


Features

OBJECT DETECTION-We were able to combine the capabilities of PyTorch, YOLO, and Python to detect objects in real-time by using the YOLO model. We were able to determine the location of certain items by using the bounding boxes' relative positions to the screen's center.

TEXT MESSAGING-We made use of Twilio to enable voice-activated text messaging between users and contacts. In order to enable user customisation, the API must have access to our authorization ID and token. We establish a unique Twilio subprocess for each new user upon registration.
